**Oasis_infobyte_data_analytics_internship**

The focus of this internship was data analytics. On the Oasis Infobyte website, I submitted an application for this internship. I successfully completed all the tasks assigned during the internship and submitted 9 out of the 9 projects across two levels. Below is a list of all the projects I've completed:  

- Level 1:4 Projects
   
- Level 2:5 Projects

**LEVEL 1**

**PROJECT-1: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on Retail Sales Data**

Using the given retail sales dataset, I analyzed sales patterns, customer behavior, and product trends to gain valuable business insights. For this purpose, I performed data cleaning, descriptive statistics, time series analysis, and visualization techniques, presenting insights through bar charts, line plots, and heatmaps.

Task-2: Customer Segmentation Analysis
Using the given customer data, I identified distinct customer segments to support targeted marketing strategies. For this purpose, I performed data cleaning, descriptive statistics, clustering using K-means, and visualization techniques, presenting insights through scatter plots and bar charts.

Task-1: Data Cleaning Project
Using the provided datasets, I cleaned and prepared the data for analysis by addressing issues like missing data, duplicates, and inconsistencies. I performed data integrity checks, handled missing values through imputation, identified and removed duplicate records, and standardized the data for consistency. Additionally, I detected outliers that could skew the analysis and visualized the cleaned data to present a clear picture of the dataset’s structure.

Task-2: Sentiment Analysis
For this project, I developed a sentiment analysis model to classify the sentiment of text data into positive, negative, or neutral categories. I used Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to process the text data, implemented machine learning models like Naive Bayes and Support Vector Machines, and performed feature engineering to improve model accuracy. I visualized the results using word clouds and bar charts to present insights into customer feedback or social media sentiment trends.


Task-3: Predicting House Prices with Linear Regression
In this project, I built a linear regression model to predict house prices based on features such as square footage, location, and number of bedrooms. I began by collecting and cleaning the data, ensuring there were no missing values or outliers that could impact the model. After performing feature selection, I trained the linear regression model and evaluated its performance using metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared. I visualized the relationship between predicted and actual prices using scatter plots.

Task-4: Wine Quality Prediction
For the wine quality prediction project, I used machine learning techniques to predict the quality of wine based on chemical features like density and acidity. I employed classifier models, including Random Forest and Stochastic Gradient Descent, to build predictive models. I utilized Python libraries like Pandas and Seaborn for data manipulation and visualization. The results were presented through bar charts and box plots to illustrate how different features contributed to the prediction of wine quality.

Task-5: Fraud Detection
In this project, I focused on detecting fraudulent activities within a financial dataset by applying machine learning algorithms such as Logistic Regression and Decision Trees. I handled data cleaning and feature engineering to improve the model’s accuracy and used anomaly detection techniques to identify fraudulent transactions. The project included the development of a system that could detect fraud in real-time and scale to handle large volumes of transactions. The results were visualized through heatmaps and ROC curves to assess model performance.

Task-6: Unveiling the Android App Market
For this project, I analyzed Google Play Store data to understand the dynamics of the Android app market. I cleaned and categorized the data, examining key metrics like app ratings, size, and pricing trends. I also performed sentiment analysis on user reviews to assess customer satisfaction. Interactive visualizations such as bubble charts and histograms were created to represent trends in app popularity, ratings, and category distribution.

Task-7: Autocomplete and Autocorrect Data Analytics
In this project, I explored the efficiency and accuracy of autocomplete and autocorrect algorithms. I cleaned and preprocessed large text datasets, implemented NLP techniques for word/phrase prediction, and optimized algorithms for error correction. The performance of the autocomplete and autocorrect models was assessed using accuracy metrics, and visualizations were created to compare the efficiency and effectiveness of different algorithms in improving user experience.
