The focus of this internship was data analytics. On the Oasis Infobyte website, I submitted an application for this internship. I successfully completed all the tasks assigned during the internship and submitted 3 projects from Level1. Below is a list of all the projects I've completed:  

- Level 1: 3 Projects
   
**LEVEL-1**

**PROJECT-1: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on Retail Sales Data**

Using the given retail sales dataset, I analyzed sales patterns, customer behavior, and product trends to gain valuable business insights. For this purpose, I performed data cleaning, descriptive statistics, time series analysis, and visualization techniques, presenting insights through bar charts, line plots, and heatmaps.

**PROJECT-2: Customer Segmentation Analysis**

Using the given customer data, I identified distinct customer segments to support targeted marketing strategies. For this purpose, I performed data cleaning, descriptive statistics, clustering using K-means, and visualization techniques, presenting insights through scatter plots and bar charts.

**PROJECT-3: Data Cleaning Project**

Using the provided datasets, I cleaned and prepared the data for analysis by addressing issues like missing data, duplicates, and inconsistencies. I performed data integrity checks, handled missing values through imputation, identified and removed duplicate records, and standardized the data for consistency. Additionally, I detected outliers that could skew the analysis and visualized the cleaned data to present a clear picture of the datasetâ€™s structure.
